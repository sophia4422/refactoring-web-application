# refactoring-web-application

For this client, I was asked to refactor the html and css for clients 'Horiseons' web application.

# What is refactoring?

Software can fail when the code becomes too complex and cluttered. Refactoring can improve the code design, this makes it easier to understand, easier to modify and easier to spot bugs.

Refactoring is not only useful for yourself but also for others who may use the code. Refactored code also helps to make coding quicker, as you can spend more time adding features and improvements, rather than sifting through code trying to understand what as been written and where errors may be.

# My refactoring 'To do List'

After reading the client's brief and looking through the provided code, I outlined a list of things to refactor.

- **Make the webpage accessible.**
  By adding alt text to images.

- **Ensure all images have alt text captions.**
  Alt text is essential to make the webpage accessible for visually impaired users. Alt text will only appear if an image fails to load on a users screen. It is also helpful for improving SEO.

Good alt text should be descriptive and specific. Describe the image with clear, useful keywords - but not too many keywords as to incur a penalty from Google. The captions should be less than 125 characters, straight to the point and lack spelling errors.

- **Use semantic elements.**
  Semantic elements help improve accessibility of a webpage. Replacing a lot of code wrapped up in < divs > and replacing them with semantic elements not only makes the code more readable to a developer but also better for those using screen-readers.

- **Include comments.**
- **Title, header, body and footer.**
- **Logical order to headings (h1 to h6).**
- **Document title (head element) is descriptive.**
- **The 'search engine optimization' navigation link is broken.**
- **There are lots of duplicate class names in css. Replace this in the html with generic names.**
