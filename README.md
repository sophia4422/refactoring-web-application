Refactoring the web application for Horiseons

# To do List

After reading the client's brief and looking through the provided code, I outlined a list of things to refactor.

- Make the webpage accessible.
- Ensure all images have alt text captions.
- Use semantic elements.
- Include comments.
- Title, header, body and footer.
- Logical order to headings (h1 to h6)
- Document title (head element) is descriptive.
- The 'search engine optimization' navigation link is broken.
- There are lots of duplicate class names in css. Replace this in the html with generic names.
